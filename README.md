# adsdb-multimodal-food-data-management
This project aims to design and implement a multi-modal data management pipeline for the domain of food and cooking. Leveraging DataOps principles, the system ingests, processes, and organizes structured multimodal data (images, text, and possibly video/audio), enabling a range of downstream analytical and generative tasks.
